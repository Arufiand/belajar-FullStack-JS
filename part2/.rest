# Notes
# Tips:
# - Start the server first: cd part2 && npm run dev (or NODE_ENV=development node index.js)
# - Use your editor's HTTP client (JetBrains: .rest, VS Code: REST Client extension) or curl to run these.
# - Ensure there is a blank line between headers and JSON body in POST/PUT requests.
